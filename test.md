Outlining testing procedures:

# Testing

Testing is crucial to ensure high quality and reliability of new features and fixes. Our testing strategy incorporates:  

## Unit Testing

Unit tests validate individual functions and components:

- **Jest** used as testing framework
- **React Testing Library** for component tests
- **Mocking** for dependencies 
- Goal of >=90% coverage

Focused on pure logic and input/output.

## Integration Testing 

End-to-end behavior across services:  

- Use **Cypress** for browser automation
- Test real backends with test accounts
- Critical user journeys prioritized 

Helps catch regression errors.

## API Testing

Dedicated suite for API routes:

- **SuperTest** for simulated requests
- **Postman** for manual testing
- Validate status codes, times, responses

Crucial for reliability.

## Manual Testing

Complements automated testing:  

- UX flows across devices 
- Exploratory tests for new features   
- Accessibility scanning tools  

Provides real-world validation.

## Coverage Statistics  

Track testing coverage for transparency:

- Codecov integration
- Coverage breakdown by file/type
- Enforce minimums for PR merges

## Next Steps

Looking to expand:

- Visual regression testing
- Performance testing
- Security auditing
