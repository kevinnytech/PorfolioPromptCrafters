Outline covering authentication and security details:

# Authentication and Authorization

RoomZone leverages [Clerk](https://clerk.dev) to handle user authentication flows and session management.

## User Registration

The signup flow allows new users to create an account using:

- Email and password
- Google OAuth 
- Facebook OAuth

Email verification required before accessing application.

## Login and Logout

Users can login and logout via:

- Clerk RE: Login component 
- Client-side JavaScript Clerk SDK
- Server-side Next.js middleware  

Session lifetimes configurable to require reauthentication.

## JSON Web Tokens

Authenticated sessions managed via JSON Web Tokens (JWT):

- Payload contains user ID, issuer, expiry time
- Tokens stored in HTTP Only cookies  
- Cookies secured against CSRF
- Blacklisting protects against hijacking

### Securing API Routes

Backend API routes verified via: 

- Clerk middleware verifying session JWT
- Allow listing user IDs for test routes
- Block expired or invalid JWT tokens

## User Passwords

Passwords hashed via **bcrypt** with salt rounding before storage for protection.

## Multi-factor Authentication

Future release will offer multi-factor authentication using:

- Time based OTP codes  
- Biometric verification
- Security keys 

As an added security measure.
